# Predict_Future_Sales
The final project for "How to win a data science competition" Coursera course.

In this project, I used some tricks and created some new features. I also find some data leakages and used them to make the model better. For the last part of the project, I wrote some cells for ensembling. I used stacking as an ensembling technic. For this technic, I created four different models(using lightGBM, CatBoost, RandomForest, and linear regression) in the first level and in the 2nd level in used a linear regression model.

The competition was on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com). If you want to try it by yourself you can download the dataset on [the competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales).
